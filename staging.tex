\section*{What is simulation and modeling about?}

How would you approach building a race car? How would you support planning efforts to alleviate the impacts of a natural disaster? How would you construct a strong investment portfolio for a client? These examples are challenging, and solutions certainly involve systems thinking and systems engineering. 

In this course, you will learn about the powerful combination of \emph{modeling} and \emph{simulation}, two mainstays in the toolbox of systems engineers tackling such challenges. 

After this course, you should be in a position to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Assess when modeling-based simulation is a good approach to a problem.
\item Be able to apply the repertoire of techniques and tools you learn in the course to tackle real problems systematically and rigorously.
\item Be able to evaluate someone else's M\&S-based solution to a problem.
\item Be able to take on graduate studies involving modeling and simulation.
\item Appreciate the central role of M\&S in an increasingly technical world.
\end{itemize}

You have very likely seen examples of modeling and simulation in earlier courses, and perhaps in your internships. But do you really know what modeling is? How about simulation? 
%%
To reach the above goals, this course will give a systematic introduction to key topics, theory, and practice for modeling and simulation coordinated through lectures, in-class problem solving, lab-sessions, homework, and projects. By the end of the course, you will know how to:
%%
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply your understanding of modeling, model types, types of uncertainties, and model validation to a broad range of projects and scenarios.
%%
%%\item ?? Simulation as a means to sample through the lens of stochastic processes.
%%
\item Apply principles and theory for the Monte Carlo method, including the Strong Law of Large Numbers for estimating means of system variables, and the Central Limit Theorem for estimating confidence intervals. %%Learn theory and applications of the Monte Carlo method, including the Strong Law of Large Numbers for estimating means of system variables, and the Central Limit Theorem for estimating confidence intervals. %%The assumptions of statistical independence. 
%%
\item Implement stochastic models as code and conduct verification. %%
\item Conduct Monte Carlo-based spreadsheet-based simulations using the XLRisk plugin for Excel. 
%%
\item Construct single confidence intervals with adjustments for skewness, and multiple, simultaneous confidence intervals under the Bonferroni correction. %%Learn to construct single confidence intervals with adjustments for skewness. Construct multiple, simultaneous confidence intervals and the Bonferroni correction. Estimate sample size needed to generate confidence intervals with prescribed tolerances.
%%
\item Estimate the sample size needed to generate confidence intervals with prescribed tolerances.
%%
\item Model and simulate queuing systems.
%%
\item Conduct distribution modeling (aka ``input analysis'') to capture stochastic elements of a system through random variables in your model. %% Goodness of fit assessment through the \(\chi^2 \)  - and KS-tests. The Phitter tool.
%%
\item Generate random numbers and variates, and evaluate potential pitfalls when these are part of your models and simulations.
%%
\item Apply your broad knowledge of simulation logic, simulation software, common data structures, platforms, and architectures to advise on, evaluate, or implement appropriate solutions.
%%
\end{itemize}
As time permits, we will cover selected advanced topic, e.g., agent-based modeling, state machines, simulation optimization, variance reduction, pipelines/workflows, and data management, and case studies.

\end{itemize}
\end{BlockClass}

\subsection*{Software}
In this course, you will be using Python along with the free Excel plugin called XLRisk. The course textbook has instructions for how to set up your Python environment and how to install XLRisk. There will also be a lab session that helps with this, see \href{https://github.com/Gabriel-vzh2vs/SYS3062SoftwarePackage}{Python Package via UV} and the \href{https://github.com/pyscripter/XLRisk}{XLRisk website}.

You should note that there are many commercial software solutions for modeling and simulation, including Simio, Arena, AnyLogic, and Flexsim but also many others. For a range of reasons (feel free to ask about the reasons), we have chosen to not to integrate any of their educational versions in the course. 

\section*{Course components}

In addition to the lectures, the course has the following components.

\subsection*{Homework}
Homework will be posted every other Tuesday after the lecture on the course \href{https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1176037}{Gradescope site.} These assignments are integral to the learning and provide the foundation for the exams and projects.  Note that homework may take you a significant time, and we recommend starting early.

%% The assignments are designed to assess your knowledge on modeling techniques and their mechanics. These assignments should be done individually or with assistance in Office Hours, include an honor pledge, and be completed by Friday night at 11:59 pm ET, typically a week later. While there is no time limit for these assignments, they are designed not to take more than 3 days. Homework are excellent practice for exams and real-world analysis and should be started early.

\subsection*{Lab}
Simulation is not a spectator sport, and the lab is an integral part of the course, providing you with hands-on experience putting theory from the lecture into practice. Labs will frequently have ``pre-labs'' which you are expected to complete beforehand.

%% of the course  is mainly in the lab.  And the lab will  cover aspects such as creating and configuring a Python environment, a tutorial on the XLRisk Excel plugin, basics of debugging in Python, VSCode and Copilot. There will be a weekly lab assignment that maybe directly connected with lecture or expands on the concepts in lecture.

\subsection*{Hands-on activities}
Hands-on activities will be used throughout the course to help you practice the methods covered in class. These will be submitted. 
%%recognize opportunities to apply them in your own work, and discover their shortcomings. 
If you are unable to attend a lecture with hands-on-activities, you will have the option to complete these online. 
%% Students can still participate in the activities if participating online and will submit their activity on Collab under "Assignments".

\subsection*{Projects}
The class will have two group projects involving more complex problems and data sets. 
%%These exercises provide a real-world context for what we learn and are open-ended problem solving experiences that illustrate the concepts of modeling and simulation in practice. Hence, they provide the opportunity to demonstrate understanding of class material using real data to solve a goal-directed problem. 
Projects provide you with an opportunity to perform a detailed analysis as well as professionally communicate your results as a technical document and/or a presentation.

\subsection*{Exams}

Both the mid-term exam and the final exam are open-book, open-notes, and cumulative. %%requiring analytical problem solving. The final examination is cumulative. Example questions for both exams are in the in-progress Textbook.


%%\subsection{Hands-on activities}
%%There will be weekly, hands-on activities during the lecture any lecture hour, and online surveys will be conducted in class. A student who misses a Hands-On Activity will not receive credit and will not be offered a Hands-On Activity, unless he/she has given prior notification of absence from lecture to the instructors of the overall course (not the TAs).



\hypertarget{evaluation}{}
\section*{Evaluation and assessment}

\begin{BlockClass}{box-grading}
\subsection*{Grading}
\begin{itemize}
\item Homework: 30\%
\item Hands-on activities and pre-labs: 5\%
\item Projects (mid-Semester and final): 20\%
\item Midterm exam: 20\%
\item Final exam: 25\%
%% \item Miscellaneous (+/-): Final Grades are Decided using Instructor Discretion.
\end{itemize}
There will be 1000 points split between these components. Thus, each homework assignment will be worth 50 points, while the final exam will be worth 250 points. 

\subsection*{About the quality of your work} Practice generating professional work. Would your future boss approve of your homework or exam? If you were the boss, would you approve of the work? \hsm{We reserve the right to deduct points for sloppy execution of all graded work.}

%%\subsubsection*{Submission and Late Submission Policy:}
%%On the day any assignment is due you must submit an electronic copy \textbf{in pdf (NOT doc or docx, etc.)} along with source code on the GradeScope site and pledge your submission. No late assignments will be accepted in this class, unless the student has procured special accommodations for warranted circumstances.

%%We will be accommodating also due to exceptional circumstances but this is a large class so please make sure this is truly warranted and contact us as soon as possible. In any case you will do better to submit an incomplete assignment rather than a late one.

%%\subsubsection*{Illness:}
%%We try to create a safe environment, not only for our students, but also for our faculty and our staff. To that end, please stay home or in your dorm room if you are ill with or are symptomatic for any communicable disease. We would rather you stay home and work something out with us for making up work or taking an exam than for an illness to spread through the class. If you believe you are sick, immediately contact Student Health for appropriate treatment or testing at \href{https://www.healthyhoos.virginia.edu/}{HealthyHoos}.

\subsection*{Religious Accommodations}
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. If you wish to request accommodations, please notify us by email in advance. If you have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs, you may contact the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at \href{mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu}{UVAEOCR@virginia.edu} or 434-924-3200.

Students are expected to be familiar with the \href{http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud}{university honor code}, including the section on academic fraud.''
\end{quote}

%%In summary, if assignments are individual then no two students should submit the same source code -- any significant, unexplainable overlap in source code of sufficient similarity will be flagged as failure to abide to the Honor Code. You can discuss, you can share resources, you can talk about the assignment but not share code as this incurs an honor code violation. Regardless of circumstances, we will assume that any source code, text, or images submitted alongside reports or projects are of the authorship of the individual students unless otherwise explicitly stated through appropriate means. Any missing information regarding sources will be regarded as a failure to abide by the academic integrity statement even if that was not the intent. Please be careful clearly stating what is your original work and what is not in all assignments.

\section*{Additional Resources}

\subsubsection*{Support for Career Development:}
Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.

\subsubsection*{Student Support Team:}
You have many resources available to you when you experience academic or personal stress. In addition to your professors, the School of Engineering and Applied Science has staff members located in Thornton Hall who you can contact to help manage academic or personal challenges. Please do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for help!

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Health and well-being:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://engineering.virginia.edu/about/offices/office-graduate-programs/student-support-services#accordion716460}{Assistant Dean of Students}
    \item Elizabeth Ramirez-Weaver, CAPS counselor
    \item Katie Fowler, CAPS counselor
\end{itemize}
You may schedule time with the CAPS counselors through \href{https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/getting-started-caps}{Student Health}. When scheduling, be sure to specify that you are an Engineering student. You are also urged to use \href{https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/timelycare}{TimelyCare} for either scheduled or on-demand 24/7 mental health care.

\subsubsection*{Community and Identity:}
The Center for Connection in Engineering (CCE) is a student space dedicated to connecting groups in Engineering. It exists to connect students with the academic, financial, health, and community resources they need to thrive both at UVA and in the world. The CCE includes an open study area, event space, and staff members on site. Through this space, we affirm and empower participation and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.

\subsubsection*{Harassment, Discrimination and Interpersonal Violence:}
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - \href{http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence}{www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence}.

The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior.

If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to Just Report It (\href{http://justreportit.virginia.edu}{justreportit.virginia.edu}) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.

If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to \href{https://mentalhealthservices.studenthealth.virginia.edu/}{Counseling \& Psychological Services (“CAPS”) } and \href{https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/}{Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates} (for students of all genders).

As your instructors, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. By University Policy, all of us are responsible employees, which means that we are required by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to us to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community.
